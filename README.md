# THE SPARKS FOUDATION | GRIP | Internship
## TASK 1
The task 1 of my internship in the field of Data Science & Business Analysis. It mainly focus on making prediction using supervised Machine Learning, i.e. Regression Analysis. Regression problems are prevalent in machine learning, and regression analysis is the most often used technique for solving them. We will be using simple regression model to make prediction of our given data.

Predictive modelling techniques such as regression analysis may be used to determine the relationship between a dataset’s dependent (goal) and independent variables.
There are many different types of regression analysis but we will be using Linear Regression analysis.
The most extensively used modelling technique is linear regression, which assumes a linear connection between a dependent variable (Y) and an independent variable (X). It employs a regression line, also known as a best fit line. The linear connection is defined as Y = c+m*X + e, where ‘c’ denotes the intercept, ‘m’ denotes the slope of the line, and ‘e’ is the error term.

The linear regression model can be simple (with only one dependent and one independent variable) or complex (with numerous dependent and independent variables) (with one dependent variable and more than one independent variable. We have used Simple Regression analysis in our TASK 1. The codes are given in the file added in the Repository.
